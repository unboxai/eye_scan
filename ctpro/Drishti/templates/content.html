          Information on Cataract:
      </h2>
      <p>
         Cataract is a common eye condition that affects millions of people worldwide. <br> 
         It is characterized by the clouding of the natural lens of the eye, leading to a progressive loss of vision. <br>
         Cataracts can occur due to various factors, including aging, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, <br>
         certain medical conditions (such as diabetes), genetic predisposition, and lifestyle choices <br> 
         like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
